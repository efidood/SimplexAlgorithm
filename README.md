# SimplexAlgorithm
Solve the simplex algorithm in the simplest way and also solve two-phases and big-M With the ability to have sensitivity analysis and
Solve various linear problems by simplex method
This code uses the user interface, which is described in the code
It has the ability to solve Big M and two phases as well as dual simplex.
It is also possible to easily analyze the sensitivity of linear problems with this code and solve problems with the method of integers
